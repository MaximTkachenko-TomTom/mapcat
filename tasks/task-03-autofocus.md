# Auto-focus

Now web page shows recently added point (and maybe line too). This is useful in general, but sometimes it must be switched off.

# Button panel

To guve user control over auto focus, add a button to teh wen page that will switch auto focus on and off. In the future there will be more buttons like this, so make an extendable panel for such buttons.
