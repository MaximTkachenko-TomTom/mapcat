# Curent position

The Android app I am using as a source if commands to `mapcat` shows current location with a marker, that we call "chevron". Currently mapcat does not support displaying current position. We will add this.

# New command

```
update-current-position (51.212,3.1231)
```

The web page must show a marker that usually represents curent position on maps at new location, and remove it from the old position, if it was there before.

# Heading

If possibble, the marker must be oriented towards the direction in which current location changes.

# UI controls

Add a button on the web page to turn on and off auto following for the current locaiton.
